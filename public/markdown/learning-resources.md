## GoRails

I did the Rails for Beginners series on here (though there are a number of others) which takes you through building a rails project from scratch. Good intro and format as it's built up piece by piece. Some things can be skipped through (especially early on), and it should be noted rails has done a major update (from v6 to v7) at the time of writing so a few things needed tweaking to get the pages rerendering correctly in the series I was following. Overall good though.

Pros:

- easy to follow
- broken up into small segments
- code at your own speed

Cons:

- Could have better web practises
- Not an enthralling speaker
- Watch which rails version you're on :P
